# QCM Mobile

**QCM Mobile** is a companion application to the Quality Compliance Manager (QCM) platform.  
It simplifies capturing and managing photos in the field, ensuring each image is automatically stamped with **date, time, GPS coordinates, and inspection details**.  

The app streamlines inspection and reporting by storing photos chronologically and linking them directly to service requests, defects, and compliance reports.
